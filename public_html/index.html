                block, <a href="/wiki/Adult_Swim" title="Adult Swim">Adult Swim</a>. It premiered on December 2, 2013
                with "<a href="/wiki/Pilot_(Rick_and_Morty)" title="Pilot (Rick and Morty)">Pilot</a>" and ended on

                critical acclaim.

            <h6>Summary</h6>
            <p>Rick convinces his daughter, Beth, and his son-in-law, Jerry, to allow their son, Morty, to continue
                following him in his interdimensional adventures, promising that this will improve his school
                performance. Morty, his parents and his sister, Summer, are dragged into dangerous adventures throughout
                the multiverse, which they manage to escape mostly thanks to Rick's ingenuity.<br><br>

                When Rick and Morty accidentally turn the population of Earth into monsters, they move to an alternate
                dimension where the disaster was averted, leaving Beth, Jerry and Summer behind. They adapt to a
                seemingly identical reality, as they take the place of alternate versions of themselves who died moments
                before their arrival. It is revealed that Rick keeps using Morty as his companion, because his inferior
                brain waves neutralize Rick's genius brain waves, making him undetectable. When Beth and Jerry go on
                vacation, Rick and the kids have a party with numerous guests that turn the house into a mess. Rick
                freezes time so that he and the kids can repair the house, before their parents return.</p>
